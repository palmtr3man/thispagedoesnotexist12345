## [Unreleased]

## [2026-04-12] — F-190 Phase 2: AutoSend Retired — SendGrid-Only Boarding Sequence

### Changed
- `netlify/functions/sendgrid-integration.js` — AutoSend fully retired. Removed `sendViaAutoSend()`, `sendTemplate()` dispatcher, `AUTOSEND_TEMPLATES` constants, and `AUTOSEND_API_URL`. `sendViaSendGrid()` is now the sole send path for all boarding emails (boarding pass, boarding instructions, exec_preboard). Added `AbortSignal.timeout(10000)` (10s) to prevent indefinite hangs. `sendSeatConfirmation()` calls `sendViaSendGrid()` directly — no provider dispatcher needed. All idempotency guards, BCC rule, ASM wiring (F152), and dynamic template data construction unchanged.
- `.env.example` — removed `AUTOSEND_*` vars and `EMAIL_PRIMARY_PROVIDER`. Added retirement notice. `SITE_URL` moved out of the now-removed F-190 provider routing block.

### Notes
- Remove `AUTOSEND_API_KEY`, `AUTOSEND_TEMPLATE_*`, and `EMAIL_PRIMARY_PROVIDER` from Netlify env vars dashboard — they are no longer read.
- Smoke test checklist: see F-190 Execution Plan (Notion) — Apr 15 window.

## [2026-04-12] — F152: SendGrid ASM Unsubscribe Group Wiring + Preference Center

### Changed
- `netlify/functions/seat-request.js` — F152 complete. Added `ASM_MARKETING_GROUP_ID` and `ASM_GROUPS_TO_DISPLAY` constants. All three SendGrid sends (`seat_request_acknowledgement_v1`, `next_flight_waitlist_v1`, `internalsignupnotification_v1`) now include `asm: { group_id, groups_to_display }`. When `SENDGRID_UNSUBSCRIBE_GROUP_MARKETING` is set, both groups appear in the SendGrid preference center.
- `netlify/functions/sendgrid-integration.js` — `sendViaSendGrid()` now includes `asm: { group_id, groups_to_display }` on all boarding pass, boarding instructions, and exec-preboard sends.
- `.env.example` — `SENDGRID_UNSUBSCRIBE_GROUP_MARKETING` comment updated to note F152 preference center behaviour.

---

## [2026-04-12] — F117: Netlify Function /api/seat-status (Carousel + Dock Source of Truth)

### Changed
- `netlify/functions/seat-status.js` — F117 complete. Three additions to the success response path:
  1. **`ok: true`** — canonical success flag added to all 200 responses (was absent; guard responses now also carry `ok: false`).
  2. **`opencount`** — alias for `open_count` added for carousel compatibility (F117 spec requires `opencount` key).
  3. **`seats[]`** — per-seat array added as the canonical source of truth for the carousel seat slide and dock. Built from `BASE44_SEAT_LIST_URL` when set (live Base44 query, 3 s timeout, graceful fallback). When unset, synthesised from `getCohortStatus` aggregate counts (`open_count` + `approved_count`). Always returns exactly 5 seats in stable order (`seat_1` → `seat_5`). Status values: `pending | approved | opened | denied`.
  4. **`timestamp`** — already returned by `getCohortStatus`; now guaranteed present in all success responses (falls back to `new Date().toISOString()` if missing).
- `.env.example` — added `BASE44_SEAT_LIST_URL` (optional) with documentation.

### Notes
- `BASE44_SEAT_LIST_URL` is optional. When not set, `seats[]` is synthesised — no new required env var for existing deployments.
- All guard responses (VIP 451, QA isolation 422, conflict 409, catch block) now carry `ok: false` for consistency.

## [2026-04-12] — F143: Non-Selected Passenger Experience — Next Flight Waitlist

### Changed
- `netlify/functions/seat-request.js` — F143 complete. Three targeted changes to the waitlist path:
  1. **Beehiiv `waitlist` tag** — `subscribeToBeehiiv()` now returns the beehiiv `sub_id`. New `applyBeehiivWaitlistTag(subId, apiKey, pubId)` function calls `POST /v2/publications/:pubId/subscriptions/:subId/tags` with `{ tags: ['waitlist'] }` immediately after subscribe. Fails gracefully — a tag failure does not block the waitlist response.
  2. **BCC** — `next_flight_waitlist_v1` SendGrid send now includes `bcc: [{ email: 'support@thispagedoesnotexist12345.com' }]` in `personalizations`, matching the universal BCC rule from `sendgrid-integration.js`.
  3. **`BCC_EMAIL` constant** — Added module-level `const BCC_EMAIL = 'support@thispagedoesnotexist12345.com'` mirroring the convention in `sendgrid-integration.js`.
- `gate-contract.js` — `SeatRequestResponse` typedef updated to document `waitlisted`, `duplicate`, `status`, and `message` fields. Version bumped to v1d.

### Notes
- In-app confirmation state (`#seat-request-waitlisted`) and form submission handler were already correct — no changes to `index.html`.
- Template ID `d-52c178a809f94a82a3bf8cd6ebd435e9` (set Apr 1, 2026) is the live canonical ID; Notion spec draft shows an earlier ID (`d-54d82aa3007c43e0bd22a5a5ae8c36c4`) from Mar 23, 2026 — codebase value retained.

## [2026-04-08] — Feat: Studio Mission Control Gateway Wiring (tuj_code passthrough)

### Added
- `Studio/index.html` — Mission Control Gateway wiring script (Addendum Apr 7, 2026). Injects a self-contained IIFE before `</body>` that reads `seat_id` and `tuj_code` from the incoming URL query string and dynamically sets three CTA hrefs via `data-cta` attribute selectors (`boarding-signal`, `operator-trace`, `studio-entry`). Implements the CTA destination contract from the Wiring Addendum spec: with `seat_id` present, all three CTAs carry both `seat_id` and `tuj_code` params; without `seat_id`, CTAs fall back to bare URLs. Existing `seat_id` parsing in `initDepartureSelector()` is preserved and unmodified.

---

## [2026-04-05] — Fix: Alpha Cohort Seat ID Reassignment (Regex Compliance)

### Changed
- Alpha cohort seat IDs reassigned to comply with `SEAT_ID_REGEX` (`^TUJ-[A-Z2-9]{6}$` — excludes `0`, `1`, `O`, `I` for visual clarity). Previous IDs used `0` and `1` which failed the format check and would have caused all cohort passengers to land on the invalid-seat recovery screen instead of Mission Control.
  - Seat 1 Kevin Clark: `TUJ-KC0001` → `TUJ-KC2222`
  - Seat 2 Clarence Clark: `TUJ-CC0001` → `TUJ-CC2222`
  - Seat 3 Jo Ann Clark: `TUJ-JC0001` → `TUJ-JC2222`
  - Seat 4 Janelle Asumang: `TUJ-JA0001` → `TUJ-JA2222`
  - Seat 5 Monica Nadute: `TUJ-MN0001` → `TUJ-MN2222`
- Notion Alpha Launch cohort manifest updated with new IDs.
- Base44 Seat records require manual update (seat_id field on each of the 5 records).

## [2026-04-05] — Fix: resolveState() seat_id Server-Side Validation (Mission Control State 2)

### Added
- `netlify/functions/seat.js` — New `/api/seat?id=TUJ-XXXXXX` Netlify function. Validates a seat ID against Base44 (`BASE44_SEAT_URL/{id}`). Returns `{ valid: true, seat_id, status }` on success; `{ valid: false, reason: 'not_found' | 'inactive' }` on rejection; `{ valid: true, _unchecked: true }` as fail-open when `BASE44_SEAT_URL` is unset or Base44 is unreachable. Accepts `opened` and `approved` Base44 statuses as valid; rejects `pending` and all others.
- `netlify.toml` — `/api/seat` redirect wired to `/.netlify/functions/seat`.
- `#seat-invalid-notice` HTML element — inline recovery notice shown in landing state when a seat_id is rejected. Links to Signal newsletter for re-entry.

### Changed
- `index.html` — `getSeatId()` split into `getSeatIdRaw()` (sync, format-only) and `validateSeatId(id)` (async, calls `/api/seat`). `rerender()` now runs `fetchStatus()` and `validateSeatId()` in parallel via `Promise.all()`. On explicit rejection (`valid: false`), strips `seat_id` from URL via `history.replaceState` and surfaces `#seat-invalid-notice`. Fail-open on network error or timeout preserves existing behaviour when Base44 is unconfigured.
- `index.html` — Seat ID Entry Modal confirm handler upgraded to call `/api/seat` before navigating. Shows server-side error message on `valid: false`; fails open on network error.
- `gate-contract.js` — `resolveState()` upgraded to v1c. Now calls `GATE.VALIDATE_SEAT` after regex validation. Same fail-open contract. Accepts `{ skipSeatValidation: true }` opt for test environments.

## [2026-04-05] — Fix 3a + 3b: Mission Control CTA URL Canonicalization

### Fixed
- `netlify/functions/sendgrid-integration.js` — Fix 3b: `passport_url` corrected from `${siteUrl}/Studio?seat_id=...` to `${siteUrl}/?seat_id=...` (was landing on `/Studio` instead of Mission Control root). `encodeURIComponent` removed from `passportUrl`, `firstTaskUrl`, and `secondaryUrl` construction — seat_id chars (A–Z, 2–9, hyphen) are URL-safe; encoding was a no-op but violated the canonical spec.
- `netlify/functions/seat-request.js` — Fix 3b: `encodeURIComponent` removed from `passportUrl` construction. Canonical form locked: `https://www.thispagedoesnotexist12345.com/?seat_id=TUJ-XXXXXX`.
- Fix 3a: `?status=boarded` param confirmed absent from all templates and server-side URL construction. No changes required.

### Changed
- `sendgrid-templates/boarding_pass_free_v1.html` — Fix log updated; last-updated date bumped to 2026-04-05.
- `sendgrid-templates/boarding_pass_paid_v1.html` — Fix log updated; last-updated date bumped to 2026-04-05.
- `sendgrid-templates/boarding_instructions_free_v1.html` — Fix log updated; last-updated date bumped to 2026-04-05.
- `sendgrid-templates/boarding_instructions_paid_v1.html` — Fix log updated; last-updated date bumped to 2026-04-05.
